### Addendum (Reference & Inspiration)

Awesome Design Tools & Plugins & Conferences are curated by [Lisa Dziuba](https://twitter.com/LisaDziuba) & [Valia Havruliyk](https://twitter.com/ValiaHavryliuk) from Flawless team. And it was hugely inspired by articles from the design community and Prototypr.io Toolbox made by our good friend Graeme Fulton. If you found some great design tool, plugins or conferences, please [suggest it](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Contribution_Guidelines.md). Thanks for making this project awesome :)
